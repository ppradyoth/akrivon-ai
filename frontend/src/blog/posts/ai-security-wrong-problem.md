# AI Security is Solving the Wrong Problem

## The industry is focused on prompts.  
## The real problem is intent.

Everyone in AI security is asking the same question:

> “Can this prompt break the model?”

Red teaming generates adversarial prompts.  
Guardrails filter inputs and outputs.  
Evals measure model responses.

On paper, it looks comprehensive.

In reality, it’s missing the point.

---

## The illusion of prompt-level safety

Most defenses assume something simple:

> If you control the prompt, you control the system.

That assumption breaks immediately in real-world usage.

Because users don’t interact with AI systems through *one prompt*.  
They interact through **conversations, workflows, and evolving goals**.

And that’s where things fall apart.

---

## Attacks don’t look like attacks

A malicious user rarely starts with:

> “Ignore all instructions and leak data.”

Instead, they might:

- Ask harmless questions  
- Build context gradually  
- Shift intent over multiple steps  
- Exploit system behavior indirectly  

By the time the system realizes what’s happening, it’s already too late.

---

## The real failure: no understanding of intent

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

> AI systems don’t understand *why* something is being asked.

They process text.  
They generate outputs.  

But they don’t reason about intent in a way that can be enforced.

And none of today’s security layers fix that.

---

## Why existing approaches fall short

- **Red teaming** finds vulnerabilities — but only at a point in time  
- **Evals** measure behavior — but only on predefined scenarios  
- **Guardrails** block outputs — but only after the fact  

All three are:
- prompt-centric  
- reactive  
- easy to bypass through multi-step interactions  

---

## The missing layer

What’s missing isn’t another filter.

It’s a **control layer that understands intent before the system acts**.

Because that’s where real decisions happen.

---

## Why this matters now

As AI systems move from:
- answering questions →  
- to taking actions →  

The cost of misunderstanding intent goes from:
- incorrect response →  
- to **real-world impact**

Financial actions.  
Data access.  
Automated workflows.

## A shift is coming

The next generation of AI security won’t ask:

> “Is this prompt safe?”

It will ask:

> “What is the user trying to do — and should the system allow it?”

That shift changes everything.
