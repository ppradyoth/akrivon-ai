# The Missing Layer in AI Systems: Intent

## Every AI system has a boundary.  
## Most just don’t know where it is.

When you deploy an AI system, you implicitly define:

- what it should do  
- what it should not do  

That boundary is critical.

And today, it’s mostly unmanaged.

---

## Where boundaries exist today

Right now, boundaries are enforced through:

- prompts (instructions)  
- guardrails (filters)  
- evals (testing)  

But these are all indirect.

They don’t define the boundary explicitly.  
They try to *approximate* it.

---

## The problem with implicit boundaries

If you can’t clearly define a boundary, you can’t:

- test it properly  
- enforce it consistently  
- monitor when it’s violated  

That’s why failures feel unpredictable.

Because they are.

---

## Intent is the true boundary

At its core, every interaction answers:

> “What is the user trying to achieve?”

That is the real boundary.

Not the exact wording.  
Not the model output.

---

## Why intent changes everything

The same prompt can have:

- safe intent  
- unsafe intent  

Example:

“Help me understand this API”

Could mean:
- legitimate development  
- or probing for vulnerabilities  

Prompt-level systems treat both the same.  
Intent-level systems do not.

---

## Introducing the intent layer

A proper AI system needs:

### 1. Intent detection
Understand what the user is trying to do.

### 2. Boundary definition
Define what intents are allowed or restricted.

### 3. Enforcement
Control execution before the system acts.

## From model-centric to system-centric

Most AI tooling today focuses on:
- the model  

But real-world systems involve:
- APIs  
- workflows  
- actions  
- data access  

Security must operate at that level.

---

## The future of AI systems

As AI moves toward:
- agents  
- automation  
- decision-making  

The importance of intent becomes unavoidable.

Because:

> systems will act, not just respond

---

## Final thought

The industry is building better models.

But without understanding intent, we are still:
